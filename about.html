        <p>My name is Juan Paramo. Im currently 17years old. I'm currently a student attending Western International. I going into my last year as a high school student. I was born in Guanajuato, Mexico and moved to the United states at the age of 9. I have a very high interest in technology, especially in how it works such as the coding behind it. I'm hoping to get accepted into Oakland University and study either computer scince or software engineer. I beleive there is nothing more creative than coding because the possibilities are endless and even after you've graduated from a University, you are still constantly learning. </p>
